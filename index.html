				In Vol. 8 of <a href="https://www.codecentric.de/wissen/softwerker/">Der Softwerker</a> - which I recommend to take a look at if you are a german speaking developer - are some really nice adult-coloring-images (I think thats the name of the recently hyped pictures) of animals. Because my girlfriend loves rhinos I wanted to get the image on page 64. So I downlaoded the pdf and opened the page with Inkscape and the shown settings.
			</p>
			<img style="max-width: 974px" src="pictures/inkscape_importDialog.png" alt="Inkscape import dialog">
			<p>
				I removed the text and already filled color with ease but then I recognized that the rhino itself was no vector image. <b>Why do you do this?! I want nice sharp and scaling vector images!</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Luckily Inkscape is a mighty tool. With the function <em>Trace Bitmap</em> I vectorized the image. The only diffuculty is to find out what parameters are good for the given image.
			</p>

				<p>Raster image</p><p>Vector image</p>
			</div>
			<p>The result is a clean sharp scalable and  850 kb image instead of a 2220 kb raster image with all its disadvantages. You can right-click on the images to show them in a new tab and zoom in to see the differences.</p>

				After installing the Creators Update (1704) I again met a bug I once had with windows 8. Every time I woke up my system from sleep all windows were resized to 1024 Ã— 768 and stacked in the upper left corner.
			</p>
			<p>
				Luckily I remembered <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/windows-7-movesresizes-windows-on-monitor-power/1653aafb-848b-464a-8c69-1a68fbd106aa?auth=1">where to find a solution</a>. The solution was - like in my previous post - modifying something in the registry. I just had to edit the two keys <code>PrimSurfSize.cx</code> and <code>PrimSurfSize.cy</code> <b>... in every shown subfolder!</b>

				I hate this database called registry because you never knows where to find a specific setting or how it's related to the installed programs. In Linux you can often predict where to look for the settings if something is going wrong - readable config files in the ~/.config folder.

				Damn Windows 10. My File Explorer crashed every time because something in QuickAccessToolbar was broken. That's what I found out by looking through the Event Log.

				After lots of research I found out how to fix the Problem.
				Deleting the following registry resets the QuickAccessToolbar: <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Ribbon\QatItems</code>

					I always wanted one of those cute Raspberries, even if I didn't know what for - just out of curiosity and because they look so cute and all the things you could do with them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally I decided to buy the new Raspberry Pi Zero W  because of the now integrated WLAN/Bluetooth-Chip and my OneDrive-Storage getting to small for all my important stuff. My plan was to setup my <em>own Cloud-Server</em> (Got it? OwnCloud). Luckily Amazon had a 200 GB MicroSD-Card on sale, which perfectly fitted my needs.
				</p>
				<p>
					After setting up <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Raspian</a> I installed OwnCloud and was disappointed that the troughput was just about 2 MB/s.
				</p>
				<p>
					After my attempt to abuse this little computer as Cloud-Storage I began experimenting with it as controller for some electro-mechanical devices. After all thats what all Raspberry Pis are designed for.

				It was the first time that I made software interact with the physical world by writing a Python script that reacted to pressing a button by switched on LEDs, making noise and starting a motor. After aborting my studies in electrical engeneering it was the first time I understood how fascinating this stuff can be. I GOT HYPED! I whish I had such toys in my childhood.

				After that I thought about a usefull project. On a weekend trip I got the idea that I need a maschine that releases foot inside our guinea pigs cage, so they don't starve if we are some days away. So I ordered some parts online and need to pick up my old LEGO boxes to build a first prototype.

				While exploring recent wallpaper commits on <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">Deviantart</a> I found a <a href="http://puscifer91.deviantart.com/art/OnePlus-2-Wallpaper-4K-554361312">nice wallpaper</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				But instead of uploading a scalable vector graphic (where you can easily edit size, aspect ration, colors, shapes and more) they just provided an archive with 5 viewports being 32 MB large?!
			</p>
			<p>
				I just don't get it. Why wouldn't you provide an SVG for a picture like this, cause i think it was also designed in a vector program.
			</p>
			<p>
				So I decided to do a remake with my beloved Open Source vector software <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here is the 7.41 kb small result:
