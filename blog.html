                <h2>2017-03-30: Meeting an old bug from windows 8 again in Windows 10</h2>
                <div class="blogBody">
                        <p>
                                After installing the Creators Update (1704) I again met a bug I once had with windows 8. Every time I woke up my system from sleep all windows were resized to 1024 Ã— 768 and stacked in the upper left corner.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Luckily I remembered <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/windows-7-movesresizes-windows-on-monitor-power/1653aafb-848b-464a-8c69-1a68fbd106aa?auth=1">where to find a solution</a>. The solution was - like in my previous post - modifying something in the registry. I just had to edit the two keys <span class="code">PrimSurfSize.cx</span> and <span class="code">PrimSurfSize.cy</span> <b>... IN EVERY SUBFOLDER CALLED 00!!!!</b>

                                I hate this database called registry because you never knows where to find a specific setting or how it's related to the installed programs. With Linux you can often know where to look if something is going wrong.

                    God damn Windows 10. Fucking File Explorer Crashed every time because something in QuickAccessToolbar was broken.

                <p>
                    Deleting the following registry resets the QuickAccessToolbar: <span class="code">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Ribbon\QatItems</span>

                <p>
                    While exploring recent wallpaper commits on <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">Deviantart</a> I found a <a href="http://puscifer91.deviantart.com/art/OnePlus-2-Wallpaper-4K-554361312">nice wallpaper</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But instead of uploading an scalable vector graphics (where you can easy edit size, aspect ration, colors, shapes and more) they just provided an archive with 5 viewports being 32 mb large?!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just don't get it. Why wouldn't you provide an SVG for a picture like this, cause i think it was also designed in a vector program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I decided to do a remake with my beloved Open Source vector software <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>.

                    Here is the 7.41 kb small result:
